# Netlify Redirects File for SPA (Single Page Application)
# This ensures all routes are handled by React's client-side routing
# Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

# Redirect all requests to index.html (except static assets)
# The 200 status code means it's a rewrite, not a redirect
/*    /index.html   200
